## Overview

**Grade Checker** is a C++ console application designed to collect student names and their grades across five subjects, calculate their average, and display it alongside their details. It follows a structured approach to input handling and adheres to specific naming conventions for readability and organization.

### Key Features

- Input collection for student names, section, and school.
- Grade input and average calculation across five subjects.
- Option for users to continue or exit the program after each calculation.

### Technology

## Naming Conventions and Guidelines

The code follows these naming conventions:

1. **Variables**: `camelCase`
2. **Constants**: `SNAKE_SCREAMING_CASE`
3. **Functions**: `PascalCase`

Additional Guidelines:

- Naming should be meaningful and use only standard abbreviations.
- Code blocks should separate constants, variables, and logic clearly.
- Avoid using global variables (automatically results in a score of zero if used).

## Code Activities

This project includes several additional coding exercises to practice similar logic:

1. **Visitor Age and Payment**: Collect visitor names and ages to assign payment levels (Kids, Adult, Senior) based on age.
2. **Sari-Sari Store System**: Allows users to select items, calculates total cost, and generates a receipt.
3. **Group Payment for Park Entry**: Compute total clients in a group, assign a group name, and handle entry payment.
4. **Employee Salary Calculation**: Calculate salary based on hours worked, with bonus rates for night and early morning shifts.

By following structured naming conventions and including multiple hands-on activities, this project supports clear and consistent coding practices.
